Vision: Preparing humanity to live without language or cultural barriers across the Milky Way - a borderless world where small talk flows naturally, effort creates opportunity, and learning English or any language builds understanding between humans and their Kokorobots.
RPG for Humanity imagines a borderless civilization where language and culture no longer divide us. On Station M31, every dialogue between human and Kokorobot breaks a barrier—small talk flows freely, jobs emerge from curiosity and effort, and players from every nation learn to understand one another through play.
English learners gain confidence through friendly inference and repetition, while native speakers experience the beauty of other languages and personalities. Together, they prepare humanity to thrive without borders - socially, linguistically, and emotionally - through the hearts of Kokorobots.
Each Kokorobot speaks one non-English language with a unique tone and personality. Players infer meaning through dialogue; every successful exchange earns “Earth investment” to build jobs and habitats for Kokobots - preparing humanity and AI companions for life beyond Earth.

### 🧠 Learning Model: The SLM Loop  
Understanding blooms through observation, recognition, inference, and repetition until meaning becomes yours.  

At the heart of RPG for Humanity is the **Structured Language Mastery (SLM)** loop—a design pattern that turns dialogue into comprehension:

1. **Recognition** - The player identifies words, tones, and gestures through Kokorobot’s one-sentence responses.  
2. **Inference** - The player infers meaning and replies in English (or a mix of languages).  
3. **Mastery of Effective Communication** - Through recap and correction, the player refines expression until clarity and empathy emerge.

This loop transforms language learning into an act of connection. Each conversation builds understanding not only between human and AI but across cultures.
